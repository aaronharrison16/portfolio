            <p>My name is Aaron Harrison and I am a young computer science student from Utah. I am relatively new to the world of coding, but with that comes a passion to learn the best practices, as well as the best habits that will set me up for success. Right now, my primary focus is on web development, but down the road I would like to add mobile development to my repertoire. I have a passion for technology, and learning the science that makes it all possible. I like to keep up with the latest news, as well as trends in the tech-world, which is a habit I feel will set me up for success in this rapidly growing industry. Please feel free to reach out to me if you would like to get in contact, or if you have any questions.</p>
